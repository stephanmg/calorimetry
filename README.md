CALOR is a holistic web application for data integration, visualization and statistical analysis of indirect calorimetry measurements which can be acquired by various platforms during for indirect calorimetry experiments in the wet lab to the end of metabolic phenotyping.

# For users

Documentation available through Github Pages: https://stephanmg.github.io/calorimetry

The app is available on the following web sites: 
- [CALOR in ShinyApps](https://calorimetry.shinyapps.io/calorimetry/) or 
- [CALOR on on-premise Uni Bonn](https://shinys.iaas.uni-bonn.de/Calo).

## Standalone Desktop apps

One can use the Electron wrapper of the app which uses docker inside the Electron app: https://github.com/stephanmg/shiny-electron-wrapper

Releases are deployed to Sciebo here: https://uni-bonn.sciebo.de/s/0qDhG2Bu1VNkRli/

## Metadata Sheet

One can use the metadata shiny app converter app: https://github.com/stephanmg/metadata-converter to generate a truncated metadata sheet.

## Caveats

- Use time averaging if cohorts have different sampling frequency in indirect calorimetry experiments (should not happen often)
- IC experiments might have not the same length of time, currently plots are thus not equal in length on the time axis

# For developers

## Option 1: DockerHub / Docker.io

1. Pull CALOR image from remote
```
docker pull stephanmg/CALOR
```
2. Start container
```
docker run --name CALOR -it -p 1338:1338 stephanmg/CALOR
```
3. Open browser and navigate to: http://localhost:1338/

Note that you can also build your own container from the `Dockerfile` provided with either `docker` or `podman`.

## Option 2: ShinyApps.io and on-premise Uni Bonn
The CALOR application is also hosted on http://shinyapps.io/stephanmg/CALOR
and deployed to our local infrastructure on http://shinys.iaas.uni-bonn.de/calo

## Option 3: Development installation
1. Clone *this* repository
2. Install dependencies with `Rscript -e "library(renv); renv::restore()"` from the current working directory
3. Run `Rscript startapp.R` from base directory (inside *this* respository)

Note for developers: After building documentation a folder `R` will be created in the root directory. Manually
delete this folder and do not add for tracking with Git, nor deploy, as this interferes with the Shiny app. 
We need to fake a proper R package structure in order to use the `roxygenise` functions, but do not need the
structure after docs have been generated.

## References

The CALOR image was created with the assistance of the AI tool DALL-E 2.
